    abstract = {{RGB-D cameras are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images
along with per-pixel depth information. In this paper we investigate how such cameras can be used in the context of robotics, speciÔ¨Åcally for building dense 3D maps
of indoor environments. Such maps have applications in robot navigation, manipulation, semantic mapping, and telepresence. We present RGB-D Mapping, a full
3D mapping system that utilizes a novel joint optimization algorithm combining
visual features and shape-based alignment. Visual and depth information are also
combined for view-based loop closure detection, followed by pose optimization to
achieve globally consistent maps.We evaluate RGB-DMapping on two large indoor
environments, and show that it effectively combines the visual and shape information available from RGB-D cameras.}},
