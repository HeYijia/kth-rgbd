\chapter{Acknowledgments}
My first thanks go to my supervisor Alper Aydemir, for his valuable advices, for carefully following my progress and supporting me to solve the problems. Beside his kindness and ability to deal with people, I could appreciate all the time he spent in discussions, experiments and even for practical issues. I also want to thank Patric Jensfelt and John Folkesson for their help. My deepest thanks go to my father Hugues for constantly showing interest in my activities and his moral support.

This work was achieved at Computer Vision and Active Perception Lab, Royal Institute of Technology of Stockholm, which I found to be a very pleasant ambient for both personal and professional developement. This comes from the school by itself, which is an ideal place for education, but first of all from the qualities of all the persons I encountered, for their availability, their involvement and the ease to share their knowledge. Special thanks to Andr\'{e} Susano Pinto for having shared some nice moments during his stay. Staff, students, or visitors, this time would not have been the same without Alessandro Pieropan, Ali Mosavian, Andrzej Pronobis, Cheng Zhang, Christian Smith, Gert Kootstra, Johan Ekekrantz, Josephine Sullivan, Magnus Bur\`{e}nius, Miroslav Kobetski, Niklas Bergstr\"{o}m, Oscar Danielsson, Renaud Detry, Lazaros Nalpantidis, Victoria Matute Arribas, and many others.
