General compatibility upgrade for the recent external libraries.
Removed the links for the configuration files.
Reorganized the data folders in the launching scripts.

Concerning the external libraries:

g2o (svn revision 30)
The g2o library uses SuiteSparse (cholmod &csparse) if present. But the csparse library is provided by g2o and compiled as external lib if SuiteSparse is not present. To avoid dependency with SuiteSparse, the solver now uses csparse and links with g2o_ext_csparse instead of cholmod. However, not very clear what libs to link with if SuiteSparse is present!

OpenSIFT (last update in GitHub 2012-07-25)
Previously named Rob Hess SIFT library has become OpenSIFT.
To be noticed a new conflict for function "basename" with string.h (found workaround)

Boost 1.47
backwards compatibility BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION with boost 1.46+
Version 2 is the default version for Boost release 1.44 and 1.45. Version 3 will be the default starting with release 1.46.

OpenCV 2.4.5
SURF feature is now part of nonfree module.
Finally, the FLANN conflict with PCL seems to be solved!

PCL 1.5
Minor API changes.
