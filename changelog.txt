Boost Filesystem V3 
A new API for Boost-Filesystem was introduced as V3 in Boost 1.46 but V2 was provided until Boost 1.49.
Upgraded code to Filesystem V3. The API is now compatible with Boost >= 1.46. 

g2o (svn revision 33)
Many parts of the interface and headers have changed. However a legacy version is found in g2o/tags/before-github-sync.
Build this version instead of the one found in g2o/trunk.
If SuiteSparse is found by g2o (optional package) there will be link errors as this in not supported yet in kth-rgbd.
To hide SuiteSparse edit g2o/before-github-sync/CMakeLists.txt and comment (#) FIND_PACKAGE(CSPARSE) before running cmake ..
When built done check that g2o/before-github-sync/lib contains libg2o_ext_csparse.so.
Use this legacy version by setting the right path set(g2o_SOURCE_DIR ..../g2o/tags/before-github-sync)

Updated src/CMakeLists.txt with new instructions. Upgrade to Boost>=1.46 and OpenNI>=1.5.

General compatibility upgrade for the recent external libraries.
Removed the links for the configuration files.
Reorganized the data folders in the launching scripts.

Concerning the external libraries:

g2o (svn revision 30)
The g2o library uses SuiteSparse (cholmod &csparse) if present. But the csparse library is provided by g2o and compiled as external lib if SuiteSparse is not present. To avoid dependency with SuiteSparse, the solver now uses csparse and links with g2o_ext_csparse instead of cholmod. However, not very clear what libs to link with if SuiteSparse is present!

OpenSIFT (last update in GitHub 2012-07-25)
Previously named Rob Hess SIFT library has become OpenSIFT.
To be noticed a new conflict for function "basename" with string.h (found workaround)

Boost 1.47
backwards compatibility BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION with boost 1.46+
Version 2 is the default version for Boost release 1.44 and 1.45. Version 3 will be the default starting with release 1.46.

OpenCV 2.4.5
SURF feature is now part of nonfree module.
Finally, the FLANN conflict with PCL seems to be solved!

PCL 1.5
Minor API changes.
